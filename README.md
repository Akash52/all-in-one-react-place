### What does meaning of these two import statement !?

```JavaScript
import React from 'react;
import ReactDom from 'reactDom'
```
 #### import React from 'react;
 - does't know how to render element 😧
 - describe only UI 🙂

#### import ReactDom  from 'reactDom;
- way to actually render It (element)
 
 ```JavaScript
 <!---  Our React element -->
 const reactElement = <div>Hello World!</div>
<!--- Our DOM element where we render UI. -->
const domElement = document.getElementById("root")

<!--- Now we put together these two element! -->
ReactDOM.render(reactElement,domElement)

 ```

## Redux Terms 😃

### Action 🔨
```
An action is nothing more than a plain JavaScript object that bundles data together.
In Redux, actions can be dispatched from the user interface or from a middleware.

• Command actions
  - command action as an API call to the server.
• Event actions
  - An event is an action that notifies the system about the beginning,progress, or ending of a procedure.
• Document actions
- A document action will always result in a state change.
```

### Thinking in Actions 💭
```
1. Fetch a list of books from a remote server.
2. Show a loader until you get a response.
3. If the call was successful, hide the loader and put the books collection in the state.
4. If an error occurred, hide the loader and put a notification message in the state.
```
### Middleware 🚀
```
- The middleware does any necessary processing of the action and passes it to a reducer.
- middleware. Every action in the system passes through the middleware before hitting the reducer.

1. Core middleware : reusable functions, process “generic” actions such as API_REQUEST
2. Feature middleware : process feature-specific actions such as SELECT_BOOK
```
### Reducer
```
- reducers are pure functions that accept a document action and pass its payload
to the state.
```
